This addon creates a proxy to a Portainer server run separately from Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar.

Note that this addon does not run Portainer itself.
Note this addon is a simple copy/edit of Frigate HASS addons (https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-addons)
